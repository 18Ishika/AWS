Learned what IAM actually is ? 
It basically tells who can access what in system
Concepts of user , groups and roles
Also added MFA for root account and also learned concept of access keys.
Different ways of accessing IAM - AWS management console AWS CLI (to locally work and  automate stuff) and for working with it in SDK or so.
